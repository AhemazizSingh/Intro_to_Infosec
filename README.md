Welcome to the first assignment of the IITK project, where we embark on a journey to empower beginners with a strong grasp of Linux command lines.

We are going to be practising [over the wire Leviathan](https://overthewire.org/wargames/leviathan/) challenge. Try them before the next session without seeing the solution, study topics regarding them such as ssh and Linux commands. I(here, Shubh) will soon be posting the write-up for them. then solve them on your own strictly. Bcoz In your mid-term evaluation, we will give you our own CTFs whose solutions you wonâ€™t find on the internet.

So, get set, go! Happy hacking.
